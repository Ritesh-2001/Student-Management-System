Filter student records based on the selected course.
Sort the table by column in ascending or descending order.
Informative pop-up messages for successful operations and warnings.

### Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used for the application logic.
PyQt6: The Python binding for the Qt framework, used for creating the graphical user interface.
SQLite: The lightweight and embedded database used for storing student records.

### How to Run
